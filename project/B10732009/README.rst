# Procedural Terrain Generation #

Procedurally generate random terrain with **[Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise)**.

**[Procedural Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation)** is a method of **creating data algorithmically** as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated assets and algorithms coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power. 

In video games,  **Procedural Terrain Generation** is very useful where you want generate natural terrain (caves, hills, rivers, etc.) that has a smooth feel, but is still random.
